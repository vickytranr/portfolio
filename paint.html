<p>Paint & Park is a game made for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-18/rate/2102919">Mini Jame Gam 18</a>, and involved drawing coloured paths for vehicles to reach their goals. This game was ranked #11 overall and for its graphics.
The game jam ran from June 2nd 2023 at 7:00 AM to June 4th 2023 at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>I drew art and designed UI, keeping it simplistic enough to fit a condensed game jam production, yet still easily navigable for a small-scale game.</p>

<h3>PROGRESS</h3>
<p>Below are wireframes to quickly mockup the UI layouts vs. polished UI. Everything was kept simplistic because of our strict deadline, so I focused on creating and finding assets that suited the style of the game.</p>
<p>Though we couldn't spend a lot of time creating unique art for the UI, I focused on the style of the typography, and the way it could interact with easily produced art to create visual interest.</p>

<h3>GAME ASSETS</h3>
<p>I was also responsible for drawing top down variations of cars, trees, and animated flags. </p>
<p>I closely collaborated with fellow artists to retain a consistent art style, and we constantly refered back to eachother in terms of approving art. </p>
