<p>This piece was created in 2020 for Ubisoft NEXT and has been recently <a href="ubi new.html">updated.</a></p>
<p>I followed a process of drawing from various inspirations such as existing IPs, as well as other visual media. 
  I then created sketches and mockups to determine layout, and with a round of feedback from judges as well as 
  those experienced with games, created final high-fidelity mockups with motion.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>The project called for the creation of a UI design for an existing Ubisoft IP.

    I chose to create designs for Farcry Primal.
    
     The <a href="https://static-wordpress.akamaized.net/toronto.ubisoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/07170339/NEXT-Showcase2020-UIArtist-Challenge.pdf">brief</a> essentially calls for:
     <ul>
        <li>a Loadout Menu UI</li>
        <li>a Gameplay HUD UI</li>
        <li>matching iconography representing damage, fire rate, ammo, and durability</li>
        <li>motion concepts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>Before I could begin designing, it was important to conduct research and answer these questions, drawing from games of a similar genre/style, and adopt some of those qualities into my own work.

        I drew from sources such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Farcry Primal, Farcry 5</li>
            <li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li>
            <li>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</li>
        </ul> 
        </p>
        <iframe id="research-prog" src= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hf6Bkqu1WBLjn7XRbnWT96J4JQxeN5VZ/preview" 
        width="500"
        height="380"> 
        </iframe> 
        <p>I analyzed the brief and pulled elements from other games to determine what information was required on each UI design. I also kept in mind the line quality, colour palette, and the aesthetic I want to follow:
      
        <ul>
        <li>using multiple mediums; watercolours, brushes, pastels, charcoal</li>
        <li>always referring back to the provided mood board</li>
        </ul>
       <hr>

        <p>I approached my design by creating wireframes on paper where I could quickly sketch ideas and notes. I sketched many aspects of my designs, creating wireframes for the loadout menu and gameplay HUD, as well as any icons or item assets.

        When created icons, I brainstormed what symbols would best represent each concept; 
        
        I had to keep in mind the simplicity vs. recognizability 

        <ul>
        <li>Texture would affect scalability</li>
        <li>Icons needed to be simple enough to recognize at a glance</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Contestants were also given the oppurtunity to ask questions and recieve <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HN21usJesPelxPEGaPCVmYdi3lfATWN6/view?usp=drive_link">feedback</a>.</p>
        <h3>Wireframes | Sketches | Iconography</h3>

    <p>I explored markmaking while creating these iterations and sketching, which helped me to solidify the style and better imagine the final design.
    </p>
    <p>
      When beginning to create high fidelity mockups, I made sure to test contrast as I went, and focused a lot on how my design would look on different environments/different lights.
      It was interesting to balance the rugged and naturalistic visuals with identifiable elements.
