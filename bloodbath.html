<p>Bloodbath is a title sequence for a film/television series about an android seeking the end of humanity after being abandoned by the human that made it.</p>
<p><i>It awakens to a deserted city in the distant future, where humans have quickly fled from an unknown danger. Abandoned in a long forgotten dusty 
    basement, and rapidly reclaiming its memories, it searches for any remnant of humanity, and vows to take revenge on the species that birthed it 
    and left it to die.</i></p>

    <h3>
        Research | Ideation
    </h3>
    <p>Sources of inspiration included existing sequences from shows like "The Last of Us", "Westworld", and "Control", which inspired me with their  elements of fluidity and physical media. I also drew from animes like "Ghost in the Shell" and "BLAME!!" with its cyberpunk and mechanical themes.</p>
    <p>I wanted this sequence to be very supsenseful, almost with a sense of dread. I also want to try rotoscope animation with this project, and think it would be interesting to be able to combine live action footage with animation. I also think there can be interesting themes to explore with the idea of fluid, and see what imagery I could created with material exploration.</p>

    <p>I created ink assets by rigging a phone camera overhead a glass container and dropped ink into still water to create the fluids I would later overlay atop my illustrations/animations.</p>
