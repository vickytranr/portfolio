<p>From March to February 2024, I interned at the <a href="https://www.communitylearninghub.ca/">Springboard Community Learning HUB</a>, which is an innovative digital learning platform that supports
marginalized populations in learning new skills such as leadership, resilience, and health/well-being.</p>
<p>As part of my internship, 
    I created an animation in order to contextualize and provide visual aid for a learning module. I created storyboards, concepts,
     and an animatic as part of my process. I was asked to create an efficient workflow that could be applied to future animations, 
     which had me plan and animate the project in 4-weeks. Final illustrations and animation time took 2 of the 4 weeks.</p>

    <h3>
        PROGRESS
    </h3>
    <p>This task provided an oppurtunity for me to familiarize myself with the Adobe Suite in order to learn new tools such as After Effects integration, audio editing, and vector work.</p>
    <p>It was important to consider the target audience, which would primarily be youths 16-19 and women. This would drive the art style and character designs to allow viewers to better relate to the scenario.</p>
    <h4>STORYBOARD</h4>
    <p>The animation brief stated a need to explore style, concepts, colour schemes, and assets, so I began by creating a storyboard to visualize what the final animation would look like.</p>

     <p class="caption">Storyboard.</p>
    <p>Feedback included using colours from the existing HUB colour palette for more brand consistency, and to draw from previous module animations. I also could find different ways to make the process
        more efficient such as with simplifying animations, using stock illustrations, and reusing assets as needed.

    <p>Previous animations used a six panel format, so in order to further optimize the process, I reduced the final piece into 4 panels instead,which greatly reduced the workload needed to produce the animation.
        Combining frames allowed for better focus onto animation required me to carefully consider the balance between a faster workflow without sacrificing intention and clarity.

      <p>Colours were also used to help convey emotion and contribute to story, while audio was used to enhance the experience and make the video more engaging.</p>
